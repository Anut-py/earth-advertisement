<h1>Welcome to Earth!</h1>
<h2 style="color: grey">The place we call home</h2>
<p>Wondering where to go for your intergalactic vacation? You're at the right place.</p>
<p>Earth is the perfect planet to go to! Here, we have liquid water, an atmosphere and magnetosphere, and much more!</p>
<div style="height: 310px">
  <div style="float: left; width: 60%">
    <p>The Earth is a rocky planet, which means it has solid ground and a (relatively) small size.</p>
    <p>Since the Earth is 93 million miles from the Sun, the temperature is cold enough that water doesn't vaporise,
      and hot enough that it doesn't freeze.</p>
    <p>This means that the water is liquid, and it is perfect for life.</p>
    <p>Since the Earth is tilted, as it orbits the sun, the Northern hemisphere gets more light and the Southern
      hemisphere gets less light, or the other way around.</p>
    <p>This leads to seasons. Whichever hemisphere has more light has summer, and the other one has winter.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, both hemispheres get roughly the same amount of sunlight. This happens twice in the year: once after
      summer (we call this autumn), and once after winter (we call this spring).</p>
    <p>These four seasons happen every year, and they each take the same amount of time.</p>

  <video src="assets/videos/seasons.mp4" width="520" style="float: left" controls></video>
  <div style="float: left; margin-left: 20px; width: calc(100% - 600px)">
    <p>The video on the left shows how this works.</p>
    <p>It shows the Earth orbiting the Sun, and on the corner it shows how it looks from the point of view of the
      Sun.</p>
    <p>In the corner, the Earth's axis (an imaginary line through the center of the Earth) is visible to show which
      hemisphere is pointing to the Sun.</p>
    <p>As you can see, as the Earth orbits the Sun, the hemispheres point towards and away from the Sun.</p>
    <p>On the surface of the Earth, we have a mix of water and land, as you can see in the video.</p>
    <p>About 71% of Earth is water and about 29% is land. On land we have landforms like mountains, valleys, canyons,
      etc.</p>
    <p>Landforms are variations in the surface of the Earth. This is why the Earth's surface isn't completely flat.</p>
    <p>These landforms are formed over time by erosion and weathering.</p>
  </div>

<div style="height: 450px">
  <div style="float: left; width: 45%">
    <p>On Earth we have 2 types of water sources: freshwater and saltwater.</p>
    <p>Freshwater is pure water that is safe to drink. It is found in rivers and lakes, and also in glaciers at the
      poles.</p>
    <p>Saltwater is water saturated with salt. Saltwater is not safe to drink, and you might die if you drink too much
      of
      it.</p>
    <p>Saltwater is found in oceans and seas.</p>
    <p>The Earth has an atmosphere made up of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% argon, and 0.1% other gases.</p>
    <p>The concentration of oxygen is enough for us to breath, but low enough that it doesn't set everything on
      fire.</p>
    <p>The Earth has just one moon. It orbits the Earth every 28 days. Over these days it goes through a number of
      "phases".</p>
    <p>This means that the moon looks different in each phase. This is because only half of the Moon is lit up by the
      Sun,
      and at it orbits the Earth, the lit part looks bigger or smaller, depending on the time of the month.</p>

  <div style="float: left; width: 65%">
    <p>As the Moon orbits the Earth, it causes high tides and low tides. High tides are when the sea level rises, and
      low
      tides are when it goes down.</p>
    <p>The Moon's gravity pulls the water and causes high tides, and when it releases the water it causes low tides.</p>
    <p>The Earth has 4 layers: the crust, the mantle, the outer core, and the inner core.</p>
    <p>The crust is the outermost layer, and it is only about 40 miles deep. This is the layer that has all of our
      continents and oceans.</p>
    <p>The crust is in parts, called tectonic plates. These tectonic plates float on the mantle and occasionally crash
      into each other, forming landforms like mountains.</p>
    <p>The mantle is the second layer of the Earth. It is made of molten, semi-solid rock.</p>
    <p>The rock in the mantle can flow, but it can only flow very slowly.</p>
    <p>The outer core is made of liquid metal. It is made of mostly iron and nickel.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div>
  <p>The outer core is hotter than the mantle because the deeper you go into the Earth, the hotter it gets.</p>
  <p>Surprisingly, the inner core isn't liquid! It's solid metal, the same metals found in the outer core.</p>
  <p>The inner core is very deep in the Earth, and the pressure there is extremely high. This pressure keeps the metal
    solid, despite the high temperatures.</p>
  <p>The spinning metal in the inner and outer core makes a magnetic field around the Earth, which blocks harmful
    radiation from the Sun.</p>
  <p>This magnetic field is called the magnetosphere. Because of the amount of radiation coming from the Sun, it becomes
    teardrop-shaped, with the pointy part pointing away from the Sun.</p>

  <p>All this and more makes the Earth your perfect vacation destination!</p>
  <p>But if you're still not convinced to come here, maybe you could see what makes our neighbor, Mars,
    uninhabitable.</p>
